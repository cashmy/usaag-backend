# devCodeCampPlatformBackend

## User Stories At A Glance (USAAG) 
The first portion of larger project to handle the "back office" activities of devCodeCamp
This project will allow instructors to assign and track user stories assignments to multiple Curriculums, cohorts, and student/team assignments.
The students/Teams will be able to update individual stories with their current status activity (i.e. Not started, Working, Completed, etc.)
An additional sprint will look at the potential of grading the user stories, and executing analyticals as the user stories are modified/enhanced/replaced.
